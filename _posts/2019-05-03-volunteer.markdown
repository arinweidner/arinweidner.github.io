Spring of 2018, I was brought into this project to provide redesign consultation. The audience for these eLearning modules were adult volunteers for a positive youth development organization. The design for this project was to onboard volunteers, a training that was typically delivered face-to-face.  This project had been partially completed, but needed updating with additional interactivity. Needs of this project were to keep a simple format as the ages and technology literacy of the adult volunteers varied, making it important that the interactions within the modules we easier to understand and follow. It is important to note, that these modules required a design that would not require fast upload/download speeds, as many of the users would be accessing this training from rural locations without high speed broadband availability.
