Starting in the Spring of 2017, I have produced, edited, and launched monthly podcast episodes with accompanying articles for blog posting for Purdue University’s Extension. The two series I worked on were “The 4th H” and “Barn Chatter”. These podcasts were aimed to reach new audiences with valuable information through a different media. Typically, this information would be submitted as an online article or social media posting, but the staff that created the content wanted a method of reaching new audiences. They wanted to be a resource for reliable content knowledge for Extension audiences and the general public. This podcast is produced for Indiana residents and reaches over 30,000 listeners via their social media platforms.
