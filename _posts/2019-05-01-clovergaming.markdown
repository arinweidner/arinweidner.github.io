As a part of Purdue Extension Startup program in Fall of 2018, I was invited to a team where we created a new program for youth grades 8-12.
Clover Gaming Connection is an innovative experience that fosters critical thinking, creativity, competition and collaboration which inspires confidence and empowers youth to design their gaming  ideas unlike any other learning experience available to youth today. Gaming and game design has the ability to teach cooperation and other social skills, as well as STEM skill sets, which are desirable for the career opportunities of today. The Clover Gaming Connection team is looking for ways to connect gaming, a passion of youth that we work with, to careers and opportunities that exist in the current and future workforce.
As a member of the team, I provided project management for the curriculum, instructional design, and program evaluation, as well as created and managed digital assets to promote the program.   Within the first 6 months, this program reached youth from over 26 Indiana counties with the weekend workshops and 31 Indiana counties committed to delivering curriculum.
