During the Fall of 2018, I was contacted by a faculty member who was interested in adding resources to a workshop they were teaching. Initially, the professor had thought a webpage listing available websites would be sufficient. After reviewing previous projects I completed for other faculty, providing more interactive exploration of course topics through learning modules was a better fit.
