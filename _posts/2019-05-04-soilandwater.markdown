During the Fall of 2017, I designed and developed these eLearning modules to provide Indiana 4-H youth members access to Soil and Water Science curriculum. This eLearning project was used to transform how 4-H content was traditionally delivered, which is typically as a paper manual. This was the first time Indiana 4-H provided online learning modules for project curriculum. Pre-existing subject matter content was translated into an online learning space, meant to provide virtual experiments, reflective learning, self-paced, and exploratory. This project was presented at the National Association of Extension 4-H Agents annual conference in 2018.
